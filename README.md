# Stronglifts Clone

Built this app over the span of 2 days using Nextjs. Learned a ton about Nextjs, server side rendering, static side generation, and data fetching. As we move back towards the server with React, I'm excited to see how using RSC changes over the next few years. 

## Screenshots & Demo

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Nextjs, Prisma

**Database:** Postgres, Supabase

## Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
